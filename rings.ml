(* ðŸ‘‰ The following code should work after you've implemented the RingPlus functor *)

(*
module FloatRingPlus = RingPlus(FloatRing)
module IntRingPlus = RingPlus(IntRing)
*)


(* Three things to try in utop: 

FloatRingPlus.(to_string (from_int 5 - from_int 3));;
IntRingPlus.(to_string (from_int 5 - from_int 3));;

Testing the efficiency of your implementations (will initially give a stack overflow):
IntRingPlus.(to_string (from_int 500000 - from_int 499999));;

*)

(* ðŸ‘‰ Override the IntRingPlus.from_int with a more efficient version,
      so that all three of the above tests work (quickly).
      (There are multiple ways to do this)
      *)
